        <p>    Self-identification can be challenging. Especially when people's early perceptions of you influence your development.
             I would say that it is hard to define the person I am today or who I was years ago. Who I am is something I have been dying to grasp and understand.
              It is an experience that comes with ups and downs. Recently, I realized that a true self-identity may never come. 
              If it were to come, this idea of self will always be in a state of not being fully developed or evolved. However, I know that the life
               I have lived so far has shaped my identity and will continue to shape, shift, and transform. The way I speak, the comfortable masculine clothes 
               I like, my daily routine and interactions, interacting and surrounding myself with people who look like me because they have also been impacted
                by the same culture and society. Not to mention, my history through years of public school and thousands of interactions, and my culture that I love so much,
                 it is all an explanation for who I am today. This explanation starts from my days in elementary school.</p>

                <h1> Class is in Session </h1>
                <p> Elementary school was somewhat of a harsh environment that I do not think I can ever forget. Growing up the students consisted mostly of color like me, African American.
                     The teachers were mostly the opposite, white. This demographic is still consistent almost today as 66 percent of all students are black (Gulfport Montessori Elementary School, 2021). I cannot tell where my consciousness began at such a young age, but I remember being different from my peers. From what I remember, I was a pretty quiet child, as I did not make friends besides the one or two I remember. My parents were there, but there was not much-planning things with me, no mom and daughter dates, no trips, and at the time I had no siblings my age. I can simplify my childhood as playing with Barbie dolls and stuffed animals, occasionally riding my bike, television, and long walks from school to home. I loved school too, a smart kid I fondly remember being the only one in class to have had the right answer to the question given by the teacher during reading time. <br> <br>During recess, I enjoyed playing football as the only girl out of all the boys, the class tomboy. Now as to why I simply liked what is declared “boy” clothes is still in question, my mom seems to remember me telling her during one Halloween, “You know I don’t wear skirts!”. The point is, that I was different, and unique, but don’t mistake me, I am not trying to say, “I am not like the other girls”. It is just that when you are different, people are uncomfortable, especially kids who just came out of diapers. Unfortunately, being a little different comes with being bullied sometimes, which definitely makes a stain on your character. I was quiet, I usually spent all my time alone, but now I was reserved and filled with anxiety. That leaves it with no surprise that today, I am still awfully quiet and have developed anxieties about who I am.  I say all this to say, that I cannot deny that I am not much different from “little ol Liyah Liyah”, as my mom would say. The places I have been and the culture I have been set in still make me have an appreciation for masculine clothing, and I have no problem with quietness or solitude. However, my voice has grown louder over the years, and I am less afraid. However, it is comforting to not participate in discussions for me, as that is just who I am. </p>

            <h1> Religion and Language </h1>
            <p>An average American black family usually has experienced the same culturally significant Sunday. Being woken up early morning around 7 or 8, getting dressed and ready while halfway asleep, and a long drive filled with gospel radio channels until reaching church. The breakfast kept me awake more than anything about God, church school, and the preaching. Marching through the long-winded speeches about bible scriptures, and the aunties telling the pastor to take his time when it is way past lunchtime. The donations, church school, the pastor, and Christianity play a role in African American culture. Fortunately, my favorite part of church was the gospel music and the closeness of everyone. Watching as everyone reconvenes at the end of the church, I hear the southern dialect of the older people talking, mixed with the vernacular of African American English. I will always love my background of language, from the sweet “babies” and “honeys” that older women would say in endearment. The fact that there was always some type of good part about church grew into an appreciation for religion. Religion to me is a routine, a reality check, a responsibility that keeps you in check and hopefully, assists you in being able to be a good person. <br> <br> Despite all that, when you are gay, religion can be your nuisance. Nothing can disregard the guilt that has been felt for being gay as a black person. I would argue that it is the most grotesque part of me that leaves older black adults uncomfortable. Black adults in the U.S. are more likely than U.S. adults overall to believe in the God of the Bible. Disconnected is a perfect word to describe how it feels to be in such a situation where your identity is seen as “uncomfortable”. I can’t deny that I have felt like something forbidden, and horrible. When middle school came around and I met people comfortable enough to be open, acceptance was there. Then, as puberty hits, I wasn’t the only one in the friend group who was unique. I think this is where my need for friends who are like me stemmed from. Though, every now and then I still pray before I eat, and sometimes feel the need to be thankful to this higher power that I am not close with. There is a closeness that I feel with religion that may never fade.</p>

            <h1> Conclusion </h1>
            <p> In conclusion, my world has been centered around the influences in my life. They have been good, bad, and meh. When I thought about an autobiography about myself, these were moments in my life that I instantly thought about. I am shaped by my own interactions, solitude, but also the interactions of others. My culture, language, and place. So, who is Aaliyah? I can describe myself as a person who is properly in tune with themselves and their interactions. But also, I have no idea what the hell I am doing and sometimes I am afraid. This is who I am, a product of influence by my background and culture.</p>
